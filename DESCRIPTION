Description: If you are a scientist seeking a convenient solution for 
    downloading, extracting, and plotting climatological data, consider 
    exploring the features of this package. It grants you access to three widely
    recognised modelled data sets, namely WorldClim 2, CHELSA, and NASA’s SRTM. 
    It seamlessly handles both multi and single geospatial polygon and point 
    data, allowing you to extract outputs that can serve as covariates in 
    various ecological studies. It also allows you to visualise these 
    extractions using two common graphic options – the Walter-Lieth climate 
    diagram and the Holdridge life zone classification scheme. The last option 
    is a scheme of our own design which incorporates aspects of both 
    Walter-Leigh and Holdridge. The package's user-friendly access and 
    extraction of globally recognisable data sets significantly enhance its 
    versatility and usability across a broad spectrum of applications.
